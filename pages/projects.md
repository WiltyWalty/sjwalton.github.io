# Those Dying Days (33 minute doc)

## The question

In 2014, the City of Cape Town announced that it was moving the Peace War Memorial from its long-term and symbolic position to make way for its extended bus provision. Did this matter to anyone and why? What did this reflect about memory, identity and the urban environment?

## The approach

1 year research project identifying key stakeholders and expertise centred on oral testimony and life histories.

Interviewed and filmed war veterans, their families, historians and a community displaced under apartheid's Group Area's Act (descendants of the Cape Corps).

Analysed in conjunction with research data, historical material and concepts around identity, and the politics of remembrance (what get's remembered and why?).

## The outcome & impact

### Key findings:

Listening to life histories revealed the memorial meaning is contested, as is the space it occupied. Race, age and gender mediated how the war was experienced and remembered.

There is no single South African war narrative and that it's significance was always going to fade in the face of political changes in the country, and white minority rule. How the war is remembered now is _political._

Some descendants felt the removal of the memorial was a betrayal, others felt that the real betrayal occurred under apartheid.

### Key formats:

33 minute research documentary, scripted, filmed and edited by me, shared with participants and screened at the University of Cape Town.

Published, peer-reviewed, research essay considering the challenges and importance of film in creating complex historical accounts which allow for a multiplicity of perspectives and voices to be heard.

### Key impact:

Descendants of Cape Corps gained support in their advocacy for claiming legal ownership of their homes.
