## Welcome to My Academic Portfolio

I am an academic researcher and lecturer with 10 years' experience in qualitative humanities and social science research and education. This portfolio showcases my work and research interests.

### Research Focus

My work has been people-centric, from life-histories to focus groups, bridging diverse communities and stakeholders. My research outputs include:

- Video documentaries
- Blog posts and articles
- Research reports
- Academic essays and publications

### Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating an inclusive learning environment that encourages critical thinking and collaborative knowledge creation. My teaching approach combines theoretical frameworks with practical applications to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

### Current Projects

I am currently working on several research projects that explore the intersection of social science and humanities. These projects aim to address contemporary social issues through interdisciplinary approaches.

Stay tuned for updates on my ongoing research and teaching activities!
